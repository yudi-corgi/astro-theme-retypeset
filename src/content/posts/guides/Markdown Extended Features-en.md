Here are some extended Markdown features supported by Retypeset, including syntax examples and their stylistic effects.

## Figure Captions

To create automatic figure captions, use the standard Markdown image syntax `![alt](src)`. To hide the caption, add an underscore `_` before the `alt` text or leave the `alt` text empty.

### Syntax

```
![Image description](https://image.radishzz.cc/image/gallery/06.webp)

![_Image description](https://image.radishzz.cc/image/gallery/06.webp)
```

### Output

![Image description](https://image.radishzz.cc/image/gallery/06.webp)

![_Image description](https://image.radishzz.cc/image/gallery/06.webp)

## Admonition Blocks

To create admonition blocks, use the GitHub syntax `> [!TYPE]` or the container directive `:::type`. The following types are supported: `note`, `tip`, `important`, `warning`, and `caution`.

### Syntax

```
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

:::warning
Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

### Syntax

``````
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
``````

### Output

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
